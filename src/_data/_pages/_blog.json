  "content": "I think a lot. After years of trying to quiet my mind, I finally realized it might be easier to accept the disquiet and give these thoughts a home on the page. As a chronic overthinker, I like to dissect, analyze, explore, discover, and learn. This blog captures some of the topics that have been drilling deep into my psyche each week. Whether it's thinking about overthinking or a case I've been obsessively following, you'll find postsÂ on writing, life, feelings, thoughts, ruminations and everything in between.",
