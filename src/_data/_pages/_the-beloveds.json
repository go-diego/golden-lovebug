  "content": "I'm always working through a few books. One for pleasure, one for learning, and one for both. Thanks in large part to the amazingness of my local library, I'm able to start a new book every few weeks. Despite this, I've barely made a dent in my endless TBR that grows more endless by the day. \n\nThis page is dedicated to reviews of my latest reads, which mostly consists of writers of color writing in all kinds of genres. Some books I absolutely loved, while some books I had to renew a few times to get through. Even if it takes me closer to a few months to read a book, I try my best to finish it. There's a writer out there who spent so much time, love, and devotion crafting, writing, revising, and sharing a piece of themselves along with their book. *And,* they were willing to share themselves and their time, love, and devotion with me as a reader. Providing me the privilege to spend hours dialoguing with them and their creation. This hardwork needs to be acknowledged. And, even if the book wasn't the right fit for me, it could be lifechanging for you.\n\nFollow [@the.bookest](https://www.instagram.com/the.bookest/?hl=en) on IG.",
