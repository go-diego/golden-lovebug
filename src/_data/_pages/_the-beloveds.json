  "content": "Thanks in large part to the amazingness of my local library, I am able to read a new book every week or two for *free*. Because of this immense privilege, I have a huge TBR list and am easily able to pick up (or download) a new book once I'm finished with the old. Here you will find reviews of my latest reads, which consists mostly of writers of colors in all kinds of genres. Some books I absolutely loved, some books I had to renew my checkout. Regardless, a book should be given the attention it deserves even because a writer out there spent so much time and love on their book and were willing to share their time and love with me. In turn, I spent hours dialoguing with their creation. Even if the book wasn't the right fit for me, it could be lifechanging for you.",
