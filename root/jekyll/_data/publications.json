As she struggled to hold everything in place, the Big Gulp slipped from the nook of her elbow, spilling the fliers all over the sidewalk. With a sigh, she bent down to collect them. A long-haired dachshund patiently watched the scene by her side."

Schlund-Vials, Sean Frederick Forbes and Tara Betts, this collection consists of 39 poets, writers, teachers, professors, artists and activists, whose personal narratives articulate the complexities of interracial life. Discrimination, instilling pride in family settings, sorting out the terms and names that people call themselves and their relatives, tackling colorism within communities of color, and childhood recollections fill these pages with compelling stories that speak to lived experiences, mapping a new ethnic terrain that transcends racial and cultural division"

Often, we are at the whim of our memories by what it decides to recall or remember at any given moment. So, who are we if and when our memory leaves us? What kind of version of ourselves do we become when all that we were is no longer privy to us? These are questions I was thinking when writing these poems.
