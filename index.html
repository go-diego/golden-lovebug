    <p>A Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.</p>
    <p>"How can it be," he sighed, "that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown."</p>
    <p>At that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which
      he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.</p>
    <p>We often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.</p>

  <h4>The Fox & the Grapes</h4>
  <div class="h-vertical-padding">
    <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
    <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in
      vain.</p>
    <p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
    <p>"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for."</p>
    <p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
    <p>There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach.</p>
