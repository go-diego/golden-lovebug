      From birth, the language we speak has been determined for us. So, frequently, the ways we see
      the world has also been determined. Yet, one of the most beautiful impacts of both art and
      writing is its ability to expand these innate limitations. Language allows us into the troves that is
      people. Language is a key into the unknown that is the "other". As a writer and educator, I
      believe in communication because it’s one of the most difficult tasks we do every day. We
      depend upon words, yet the value of these words is constantly taken for granted.

        I happened upon this realization recently. When I was younger and mentioned to an old
        boyfriend I wanted to teach, he replied with the ripe adage,"Those who can, do. Those who
        can’t, teach", which was something that haunted me. Inevitably, I wanted to do everything else
        but teach. Whenever anyone asked me what I wanted to do with an English degree and
        automatically jumped to teaching, I would shift the conversation before we could get to "What
        else can you do with an English degree?" (This isn’t even taking into account my Masters focus
        in poetry…). However, it turns out, many things &ndash;

        Years later, I began working with elementary school children during my graduate program at
        Cal State San Bernardino in a program known as S.C.I.P.P. (Students and Coyotes Instruction in
        Poetry and Prose). Having to learn how to speak to children in a way that made them not
        simply <i>learn</i> but <i>desire</i> to learn was incredibly difficult. If something wasn’t communicated
        effectively, an entire lesson and day would be left unfulfilled. Later, when I began working with
        adults, nothing changed. It’s just as difficult, if not more so, to communicate with adults.

        Words are the foundation of our relationships, with ourselves, with others, with the world
        around us. As a writer, educator and person, I cannot separate myself from words &ndash; it’s the only
        way I know who I am, which is a gift I want to give others: The ability to know who they are and
        to be understood.
