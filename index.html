        From birth, the language we speak has been determined for us by where we grew up, when we grew up and who we grew up with. 
        So, inevitably, the ways we see the world has also been determined by these same influences—where, when and who. 
        Yet, one of the most beautiful impacts of both art and writing is its ability to expand these innate limitations. 
        Language allows us into the troves that is people. Language is a key into the unknown that is the "other." 
        As a writer and educator, I believe in communication because it’s one of the most difficult tasks we undergo every day. 
        We depend upon words, yet the value of these words is constantly taken for granted.

        I happened upon this realization recently. When I was younger and mentioned to an old boyfriend I wanted to teach, 
        he replied with the ripe adage, "Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach," which was something that haunted me. 
        Inevitably, I wanted to do everything else but teach. Whenever anyone asked me what I wanted to do with an English degree, 
        I would instantly shift the conversation before we could get to: "What else can you do with an English degree besides teach?" 
        (This isn’t even taking into account the focus of my Masters is in poetry…). However, it turns out, many things &ndash;

        Years later, I began working with elementary school children during my graduate program at Cal State San Bernardino in a program known as S.C.I.P.P. 
        (Students and Coyotes Instruction in Poetry and Prose). Having to learn how to speak to children in a way that made them not simply 
        <i>learn</i> but <i>desire</i> to learn was incredibly difficult. If something wasn’t communicated effectively, an entire lesson and 
        day would be left unfulfilled. Later, when I began working with adults, nothing changed. It’s just as difficult, 
        if not more so, to communicate with adults.

        Words are the foundation of our relationships, with ourselves, with others, with the world around us. 
        As a writer, educator and person, I cannot separate myself from words. 
        Language is the only way I know who I am, which is a gift I want to give others.
