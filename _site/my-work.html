      <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them.</p>
      <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but
        in vain.</p>

                    Two Goats, frisking gayly on the rocky steeps of a mountain valley, chanced to meet, one on each side of a deep chasm through which poured a mighty mountain torrent. The trunk of a fallen tree formed the only means of crossing the chasm, and on this not even two squirrels could have passed each other in safety.

                    A Fox and a Leopard, resting lazily after a generous dinner, amused themselves by disputing about their good looks. The Leopard was very proud of his glossy, spotted coat and made disdainful remarks about the Fox, whose appearance he declared was quite ordinary.

    <p>As the sourness subdues my craving, the pickle bites memory into my tongue. When I was 12, I would chase pickles with
        creamy whole-milk, feel the milk shock my teeth like someone hooked jumper cables up to each tooth. My mom saw my
        scrunched face and laughed, That's the same combination I'd crave when I was pregnant with you.</p>

    <p>On a stroll through San Bernardino's business district last weekend, I came across a woman on a street corner gripping

        from the nook of her elbow, spilling the fliers all over the sidewalk.</p>
